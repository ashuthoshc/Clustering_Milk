# Clustering of Milk and Milk products
by Ashuthosh Chandramouli
  
When we go to supermarkets we see variety of milk cans and milk products. Have you ever wondered what is the difference between whole milk and the 2% reduced fat milk? Why are there so many varieties of milk and what is the difference between these varieties of milk. To understand the same and I have applied KMeans clustering to group all similar milk type based on the nutrient values.

## Project Goal:
Understand different types of clustering method and implementing the same to cluster the different group of milk based on nutrients present

## Summary of Data:
The dataset used for analysis is taken from [U.S. Department of Agriculture](https://www.ars.usda.gov/) It contains a wide range of nutrients present in various categories of food products. I have filtered out majority of redundant data and utilized only a portion of it.

## Summary of files:

### Data Source:
